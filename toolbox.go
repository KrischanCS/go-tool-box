// Package toolbox is a collection of packages, which I implemented out of one
// of the following reasons:
//
// - I tend to implement parts of it in different projects, and wanted to have them in one place.
// - I wanted to learn and/or play around with some concepts, which I find interesting.
// - I wanted to compare different implementations of the same concept, e.g. iterators.
//
// While there are unit tests for everything in this module, not all of this was
// ever used in production and I don't guarantee to maintain any of this in the
// future. So I can't recommend to use this in your projects. Remember:
//
// "A little copying is better than a little dependency."
