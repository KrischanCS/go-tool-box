// Package toolbox is a collection of packages,
// which are a combination of stuff I either implemented multiple times before,
// or I  want to try out and don't have a better place for it.
//
// Not all of them are idiomatic to Go, and not recommended for production code.
//
// Remember "A little copying is better than a little dependency."
