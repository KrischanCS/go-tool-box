// Package toolbox is a collection of packages, implementing various
// functionalities I tend to implement in multiple of my projects.
//
// Not all of them are idiomatic to Go, and not recommended for production code,
// but I find them useful for playground projects or tests.
//
// Most of them are rather small, so remember "A little copying is better than a
// little dependency." ([Go Proverbs])
