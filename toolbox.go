// Package toolbox is a collection utility packages for Go.
//
// The toolbox is a place where I collect stuff I either used and implemented
// multiple times already or I want to try out and don't have another place for
// it yet.
//
// I try to keep everything tested and documented, but I don't guarantee to keep
// packages in here maintained.
//
// If you find something of it useful, I recommend having a look on the
// implementation and do something similar on your own. According to the go
// proverb:
//
// "A little copying is better than a little dependency."
// ([Go Proverbs])
